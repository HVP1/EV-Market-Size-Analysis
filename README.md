## Introduction

Electric vehicle market size analysis is a crucial aspect of market research that helps determine potential sales volume, understand demand magnitude, assess market saturation levels, and identify growth opportunities. This project analyzes the market size of electric vehicles in the United States using Python and various data science libraries.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this analysis is based on the electric vehicle population in the United States. It includes details such as:

- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- County, City, and State of Registration
- Model Year, Make, and Model
- Electric Vehicle Type (e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)
- Electric Range and Base MSRP
- Vehicle Location and Electric Utility

The dataset is cleaned and processed to remove any missing or irrelevant data before performing the analysis.

## Analysis Process

### 1. EV Adoption Over Time

Analyzed the growth of the EV population by model year to understand how EV adoption has increased over time. Visualized using bar plots to show the trend of EV registrations by year.

### 2. Geographical Distribution

Explored the geographical distribution of EV registrations to identify areas with the highest EV adoption rates. Analyzed data at both the county and city levels.

### 3. EV Types

Visualized the distribution of different electric vehicle types (e.g., Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)) to understand consumer preferences.

### 4. Make and Model Popularity

Identified the most popular EV makes and models among registered vehicles to understand brand dominance and consumer preferences at a granular level.

### 5. Electric Range Analysis

Analyzed the distribution of electric ranges and how they have evolved over the years. Visualized trends in electric range progression to identify improvements in battery technology.
